🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project is based on the famous Titanic Dataset, where the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not using Machine Learning techniques.

It is a beginner-friendly classification project that covers the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

📌 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset contains passenger details such as:

Age
Gender
Ticket Class
Fare
Family Members
Embarked Port
Using these features, the model predicts:

✅ Survived
❌ Not Survived

🎯 Objectives

Understand the Titanic dataset
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Handle missing values and preprocessing
Train a Machine Learning classification model
Evaluate the model performance

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas (Data Handling)
NumPy (Numerical Computations)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)

⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

Loaded the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values
Removed unnecessary columns

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Survival count visualization
Gender vs Survival analysis
Passenger class distribution

4. Feature Engineering

Converted categorical values into numeric form
Prepared data for ML model training

5. Model Training

Trained classification algorithms such as:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest (if used)

6. Model Evaluation

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report

📊 Results

The trained model successfully predicts survival outcomes with good accuracy.
